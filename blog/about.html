					Initially, I give following proof, which is ﬂawed. The mistake is made in the claim “The remaining nodes have height strictly more than h. To connect all subtrees rooted at node in Sh, there must be exactly Nh −1 such nodes.” To see why it fails, here is a counterexample. Consider h = 2. The black two nodes has height 2, and Nh = N2 = 2. The red node, among “The remaining nodes”, has height 1, which is less than 2. Also, the number of nodes (blue nodes) connecting two black nodes is 2, instead of N2 −1 = 1
